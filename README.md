# Aviation_Delay_Prediction
PREDICTING FLIGHT DELAYS

## Problem Statement
The ability to predict a delay in flight can be helpful for all parties, including airlines and passengers. This study explores the method of predicting flight delay by classifying a specific flight as either delay or no delay. From the initial review, the flight delay dataset is skewed. It is expected since most airlines usually have more non-delayed flights than delayed ones. Hence, this study compares different methods to deal with an imbalanced dataset by training a flight delay prediction model.

## Objectives
The objectives of this study are:
1.	To identify the attributes that affect flight delay. 
2.	To develop machine learning models that classify flight outcomes (either delayed or not delayed) with selected features.
3.	To evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.

**The output whether the flight is delayed or not depends on the time; if the flight is late by 15 minutes or more then it is declared as delayed.**

**Technologies Used:**
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
6. Random Forest Regressor from Sklearn
7. Gradient Boosting Regressor from Sklearn
